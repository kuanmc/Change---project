How to Run:
you'll need to install the project's dependencies. Do this by 
- opening a terminal in the main project directory and running npm install.
- Then, switch to the 'backend' folder and run npm install 
- start the backend server with the command `node server.js` â€” you'll know it's working when you see a message confirming it's running.
- You will then need to download the video files separately. You can find them available for download on : https://vanderbilt365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/michelle_c_kuan_vanderbilt_edu/EgypTrPbuutEqRaYHRXN7-ABf4RaPo1M5xJ1ZGakYD5OYA?e=UteITg 
^ this is on my vandy account so I think you need to open it with a Vanderbilt account too 
Once downloaded, make sure the names are video1.mp4, video2.mp4, video3.mp4 and then put them in the public folder in the frontend. 
- Then, switch to the 'frontend' folder and run npm install again
- then run the command 'npm run dev' and it should show you the url entrypoint to the frontend
- Open the application in your browser, where you can start clicking 'Next Story' and interacting with all the features.


Reflection (<100 words):
This project was very eyeopening and a fun project (a little crash out) to work on. 
I haven't really done an API before so it was pretty challenging learning how to do this in a short amount of time while also wanting my ideas to work. There were a lot of things I just gave up on in the end like displaying text that would sync up with the audio. But I had a lot of fun learning how to code JavaScript and using Node/Express API.


Feedback on Challenge:
The prompt was such a fun prompt and very fun to work with. Maybe more time on this in the future would make it better? Very nice to do overall.
